### About 

 Four simultaneously recorded cardiovascular signals - ECG, PPG, PCG and SpO2, will be extensively studied and their correlation will be exploited to extract diagnostic information. A model/algorithm was created that takes these four signals as input and provides cardiovascular health index of the subject as output.
